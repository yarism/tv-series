The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Future work

- Interface of the api response.
- I would have added a debounce to the search. 
- Remember the last search query so when you go back it would still be there. 
- Fetch episode list and more details on the details page. 
- It was fun to try React Query but would have loved more time with it, first time using it. 
- Would have loved more time to put on the design, its very basic now. 
- Writing tests with RTL.
- Offline indication for the end user.
- Divide components into smaller components.
- Hastily written CSS, use rems instead, more variables.
- Switch between night and day theme based on users settings.
